00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,294
[alarm clock sounding]

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,754
Time for boating school.

3
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,214
Let her rip, Gary.

4
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,138
Ah.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,354
Ta-da!

6
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,523
Not bad, partner in crime.

7
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,983
The toast could have been
a little darker though.

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,109
See you later.

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,277
Hey SpongeBob.

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,820
Wanna go jellyfishing?

11
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,240
Sorry Patrick, I can't.
I have school today.

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,451
What am I supposed to do all
day while you're at school?

13
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,995
I don't know.
What do you normally do when I'm gone?

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,373
Wait for you to get back.

15
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,794
Wait a second, Patrick.
Why don't you come to school with me?

16
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,838
Hey, that's a great idea.

17
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,633
You and me in school together
as classmates. Think about it!

18
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,304
Wow.
